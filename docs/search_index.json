Simple Commands", " Chapter 1 What Is the Shell? “When we speak of the command line, we are really referring to the shell. The shell is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the operating system to carry out. Almost all Linux distributions supply a shell program from the GNU Project called bash. The name “bash” is an acronym for “Bourne Again SHell,” a reference to the fact bash is an enhanced replacement for sh, the original Unix shell program written by Steve Bourne.\" (Shotts 2019) Simple Commands Date Display the current time and date date: $ date Thu Mar 8 15:09:41 EST 2018 Calendar Display a calendar of the current month $ cal February 2021 Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Disk Drives To see the current amount of free space on our disk drives, enter df. $ df Filesystem 1K-blocks Used Available Use% Mounted on devtmpfs 1512552 0 1512552 0% /dev tmpfs 1528228 0 1528228 0% /dev/shm tmpfs 1528228 8692 1519536 1% /run tmpfs 1528228 0 1528228 0% /sys/fs/cgroup /dev/sda1 35634176 4182988 31451188 12% / /dev/sda3 33796768 49176 32001112 1% /backup tmpfs 305644 4 305640 1% /run/user/1001 Likewise, to display the amount of free memory, enter the free command. $ free total used free shared buff/cache available Mem: 3056460 205784 2656980 8760 193696 2689788 Swap: 3145724 0 3145724 Ending a Terminal Session Entering exit in the cammand prompt or by pressing Ctrl+d $ exit "],["navigation.html", "Chapter 2 Navigation 2.1 Current Working Directory 2.2 Listing Directory Contents", " Chapter 2 Navigation pwd – Print name of current working directory cd – Change directory ls – List directory contents 2.1 Current Working Directory To print the path of the current working directory, use pwd. $ pwd /home/kelly 2.2 Listing Directory Contents To list the contents of a directory, use ls. $ cd / $ ls backup boot etc lib media opt root sbin sys usr bin dev home lib64 mnt proc run srv tmp var "],["references.html", "References", " References Shotts, William. 2019.
